ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Welcome to my homepage!

I'm currently an Investment Associate at [Balyasny Asset Management](https://www.bamfunds.com/) in Singapore. In particular, I focus on the Fundamental Long/Short Equities strategy in India. 

I was previously a Private Equity Associate with [ChrysCapital](http://www.chryscapital.com/) covering the Consumer and Healthcare space in India.

I also spent some time as an Analyst in the front-office India Coverage team of [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) in their Investment Banking Division.

My primary interests lie in Capital Markets, Artificial Intelligence, and Applied Mathematics.

I graduated with an MBA from [Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad](https://www.iima.ac.in/) in April 2022. I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Viswanath Pingali](https://www.iima.ac.in/faculty-research/faculty-directory/Viswanath-Pingali) doing research on IPO markets in India.

Prior to B-School, I spent two amazing years as a Quant at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) working with their Mortgage and Credit trading desks.

Before that, I graduated with a B.Tech. (Honors) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) where I spent most days working on academic research in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning under the guidance of [Dr. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/).
