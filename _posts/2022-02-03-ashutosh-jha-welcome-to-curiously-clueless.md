Hello there!

 **This is Curiously Clueless** , a newsletter about Thoughts of a clueless but curious human.

Iâ€™ll use this newsletter mostly to cover my thoughts and learnings in the areas of Investing, Financial Markets, and Technology for most part.

One of the first advices I was given was:

>  _Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt_

My one simple goal through this newsletter is to go **against** this advice and make very public mistakes to learn from them. The self-indulging of my ego is just a side benefit!

Cheers,  
A
