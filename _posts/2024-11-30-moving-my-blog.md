I have been putting off moving my page and blog to Jekyll for a long time. Finally, I have done it! I'll keep posting on Substack but this will be my primary blog going forward.

We are in the era of Web 3.0 where the ownership of content should be with the creator. To that end, as a HODLer, its only natural that I walk the talk.

See you around!
